Graphical Rendering of Dynamic Weather Systems

## Abstract</br>
Whilst real-time rendering of virtual weather conditions has been thoroughly investigated before, modern development platforms are constantly improving in efficiency and computational costs. This means that techniques that were once too resource-intensive can now be employed for a fraction of the demand.

In this paper, I propose different ways particle systems, shaders and scripts can be used within Unity to produce realistic weather efficiently. The motivation for this project stems from this issue being a central concern across all features of a game.
A summary of the project contents is documented below, with the decisions on design and development justified. The results and analysis are recorded later in the document, along with the evaluation and the potential future expansions to the research of this project.
